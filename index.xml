      <description>Introduction This instruction covers the installation of ROS Kinetic (Robot Operating System) and OpenCV-3.3.1 on the Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 with Raspbian Stretch.
I have prepared an img file (made in Dec 19 2017) that compiled ROS and OpenCV, you can download it here, file size is around 4GB in Google Drive. You can download ,unzip and burn it to your SD card (at least 16GB) if you donâ€™t care the installation details.</description>
